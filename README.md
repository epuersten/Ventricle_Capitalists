NEW STUFF FOR THE DCM:

We're using C# for this so you're going to be needing Visual Studio 2017. Just use the community edition from Microsoft. You shouldn't need any of the
addons aside from the C# package. After it's installed, you can just go ahead and open up the .sln in the PacemakerClient folder, which will get you
what I've gotten done thus far
